# Swarm

Fan out N parallel background subagents. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open the task list (`TaskCreate`) with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not a concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from `swarm workers` in `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` when present. Otherwise use `sonnet`. A value of `inherit` means omit `model`. For a model race, name each arm's model up front (`fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`). If the `Agent` call rejects a `model` value, drop one tier and note the substitution in the report.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and the configured model. Agent calls in one message run in parallel in the background, and you are notified as each completes. Give every worker that writes `isolation: "worktree"` so it gets its own git worktree. Read-only workers need no isolation. Use `isolation: "remote"` only when the session offers it.

When a worker must start from a non-default branch, put the branch in the brief. A worktree worker runs `git fetch && git checkout <branch>` first.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
