# benny automation intent

## what i want to automate

i want two claude code routines that work together in one slack issue channel.

routines have scheduled, api, and github triggers. none of them fires on a slack message, so benny polls the channel through the slack connector.

### routine 1: triage issue reports

- trigger: i want this routine to run on a schedule, read the new top-level reports in my configured source slack channel through the slack connector, and start on each report that has no benny verdict yet. it keeps each report's original thread coordinates.
- idempotency: a report counts as handled once a reply from my configured triage identity in its thread carries a benny marker. a run skips handled reports, so an overlapping or repeated run never posts a second verdict.
- behavior: i want it to read the thread and attachments, classify the report as a bug or performance issue, feature request, question or feedback, or reroute, and trace the likely owning layer before routing.
- tracker: i want it to search my configured tracker for duplicates, update a confident duplicate, and create a ticket only for a clear net-new bug.
- tools: i want slack thread read and reply access through the slack connector, my configured tracker integration, and my optional routing map.
- outcome: i want exactly one reply in the source thread with a short verdict and `[benny:bug]`, `[benny:performance]`, or `[benny:other]`. a bug or performance marker may include the tracker url.
- boundary: i never want this routine to post a root message in the source channel.

### routine 2: reproduce and fix confirmed bugs

- trigger: i want this routine to run on its own schedule and pick up threads that carry a trusted bug or performance marker and no benny repro claim. if i choose the api trigger during setup instead, triage fires it once per bug or performance verdict with the report coordinates in the request text. either way it waits for the trusted triage marker in the original thread.
- idempotency: before any work it claims the report with the configured status reaction on the source root, or with its operations-thread root when reactions are unavailable. a run skips any report that already carries a claim.
- gates: i want it to stop when someone clearly owns the fix. if an existing pull request or merged commit may fix the report, i want verification instead of a competing change.
- behavior: i want it to use my configured control adapter and feature map, reproduce the exact symptom twice through the real ui, and capture screenshots, video, and a read-only state cross-check.
- fix: i want it to verify existing pull requests without authoring over them. after a confirmed repro, it may attempt one bounded root-cause fix, use tdd when the test is cheap, smoke the blast radius, and open a draft pull request only when before-and-after proof passes.
- tools: i want slack thread read and reply access through the slack connector, repository and history access, draft pull request creation, my configured tracker, and my control adapter.
- outcome: i want evidence and a verified result in the source or optional operations threads, plus an optional draft pull request. updates should be concise.
- boundary: i never want this routine to post a root message in the source channel.

### shared rules

- i want the source channel and root thread coordinates to stay immutable for the whole run.
- i treat utility and debug bots as evidence, not delegation or fix ownership.
- i allow subagents to help, but they cannot post to slack or receive slack credentials. claude code subagents inherit the session's mcp tools, including the slack connector, so a stock subagent does not meet this rule on its own.
- i want this entire pack committed at `.claude/automations/benny/` in the target repository. its `SKILL.md` files are direct routine instructions, not registered plugin skills.
- i want pstack enabled through the target repository's committed `.claude/settings.json` only for shared dependencies such as `how`, `why`, `tdd`, `unslop`, and the required principle skills.
- i want each routine prompt to read its committed operational file directly. i do not want plugin cache paths, copied excerpts, or slash-skill discovery.
- i keep user-owned configuration, feature maps, routing maps, and secrets outside `.claude/automations/benny/` so pack refreshes cannot overwrite them.
- i want both routines to fail closed when channel coordinates, tracker access, the control adapter, or the feature map are missing or uncertain.
- i want draft pull requests only. do not merge or deploy.

### my configuration

- source slack channel: `<channel>`
- optional operations channel: `<channel or none>`
- repository and default branch: `<repo>`, `<branch>`
- tracker: `<type, team, project, labels, intake status>`
- routing map: `<path or none>`
- triage identity: `<slack identity that the triage routine's slack connector posts as>`
- control skill: `<configured skill or adapter>`
- feature map: `<committed same-repo path outside the copied pack, or behavior to paraphrase>`
- schedules: `<triage cron, repro cron or api trigger>`
- models: `<triage, reproduce, code, media review, each fable, opus, sonnet, haiku, or inherit>`
- status emoji strings: `<seen, reproducing, reproduced, blocked, fixing, failed, pull request opened>`
- budgets: `<polling, lookback, reports per run, verdict wait, follow-up, repro, rejection, fix>`
- optional bot token capability: `<none, file download, or editable operations status>`

start from [`configuration.example.yaml`](./templates/configuration.example.yaml) and [`feature-map.example.md`](./skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md). copy and fill them outside this pack, for example under `.claude/benny/`. keep secret values in a secret manager or the routine's environment.

## for the agent

the human enters setup by pointing claude code at this file. do not look for or invoke a discovered benny slash skill.

1. ask which repository will run the routines.
2. treat the directory containing this `FOR_AGENTS.md` as the source pack.
3. merge the entire source pack into `<target-repository>/.claude/automations/benny/`.
4. preserve every destination-only file. never delete unrelated files or overwrite user-owned configuration, feature maps, or routing maps.
5. when an existing destination file at a source-managed path differs, review the diff and merge without discarding local edits. if ownership is ambiguous, stop and ask before replacing it.
6. verify that the copied `FOR_AGENTS.md` and `skills/setup-benny/SKILL.md` exist in the target repository.
7. read and follow `.claude/automations/benny/skills/setup-benny/SKILL.md` directly from the target repository.

i want you to merge these entries into the target repository's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
	"extraKnownMarketplaces": {
		"pstack-for-claude": {
			"source": {
				"source": "github",
				"repo": "that-mathevs/pstack-for-claude"
			}
		}
	},
	"enabledPlugins": {
		"pstack@pstack-for-claude": true
	}
}
```

preserve every unrelated setting, marketplace, and plugin. check the merged file against the claude code settings documentation, and run `claude plugin validate` where it applies, before relying on it.

i want verification from a fresh claude code session rooted in the target repository. confirm that pstack's `how`, `why`, `tdd`, `unslop`, and the principle skills used by benny resolve from project settings. do not count skills loaded from the current session, a user-scoped install, or `~/.claude/skills/`.

if project-scoped plugins are unavailable or any shared dependency does not resolve, stop and explain what failed. do not add `.claude/automations/benny/skills/` to a plugin manifest or expect its files to appear in the slash-skill list.

tell me that `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/automations/benny/`, and any referenced secret-free configuration must be committed and pushed to the branch the routines check out before either routine is created. do not create or update a routine until i explicitly ask.

for first-time creation, use `/schedule` once for triage and once for repro and fix. finish the draft review, my approval, and creation of the first routine before starting the second.

paraphrase this intent and the finished configuration into each draft. the triage prompt must read and follow `.claude/automations/benny/skills/triage-issue-reports/SKILL.md`. the repro prompt must read and follow `.claude/automations/benny/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md`. use these repo-relative paths only after you confirm they are committed and pushed in the repository the routine will check out.

for existing routines, do not create new ones. validate the configuration, then use the concise field checklist in the copied setup file so i can edit each routine on its routines page at claude.ai/code, or with `/schedule` once i say go. do not create duplicates.
