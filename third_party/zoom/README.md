# Zoom

Cursor plugin that connects agents to [Zoom](https://zoom.us) through Zoom's official hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers.

Search meetings and recordings, pull summaries and transcripts, and work with Zoom Docs from chat.

<!-- claude-code:start -->
## Install in Claude Code

Add the MCP server this plugin uses:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user \
  --client-id <client-id> \
  --client-secret \
  --callback-port 8787 \
  zoom \
  https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/zoom/streamable
```

- Replace `<client-id>` with the client ID of the OAuth app described in Setup. Register `http://localhost:8787/callback` as a redirect URL on that app. `--client-secret` prompts for the secret without echoing it.
- Run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to finish any sign-in and check that the server connected.
- `--scope user` makes the server available in every project. Use `--scope project` to share it through the repo's `.mcp.json`.

<!-- claude-code:end -->

## Install

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Plugins**.
2. Search for **Zoom**.
3. Click **Install**, then set the client ID and secret (below) and complete the Zoom sign-in prompt.

Or run `/add-plugin zoom` in chat.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zoom": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/zoom/streamable",
      "auth": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "${CLIENT_ID}",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "${CLIENT_SECRET}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup

Zoom's MCP servers only support manual client registration — Dynamic Client Registration and Client ID Metadata Documents are not accepted — so an administrator has to register Cursor as a Zoom app before anyone can connect.

1. A Zoom admin or developer logs into the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us) and creates a **General app** under **Develop → Build app**.
2. Add the scopes listed for each tool in [Zoom's MCP server docs](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/mcp/servers/). Meeting search and recordings need `ai_companion:read:search` for cross-Zoom search.
3. Under **Basic Information → OAuth Information**, register both redirect URIs:
   - Desktop: `http://localhost:8787/callback`
   - Web and Cloud Agents: `https://www.cursor.com/agents/mcp/oauth/callback`
4. In **Dashboard → Plugins → Configure**, set **Zoom Client ID** and **Zoom Client Secret** from that app's **App Credentials**.
5. Complete the Zoom OAuth login when Cursor prompts.

Each member needs a license for the Zoom products they want to reach. On a team marketplace an admin sets the client ID and secret once for everyone; each member still completes their own Zoom OAuth login, so tool calls run with that member's Zoom permissions.

## Other Zoom MCP servers

Zoom splits tools across product-specific servers. This plugin ships the main `zoom` server, which covers meeting search, cross-Zoom search, recordings, summaries, meeting assets, and the main-server Zoom Docs tools. To reach the others, add them to `mcp.json` with the same `auth` block:

| Server | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Zoom Docs | `https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/docs/streamable` |
| Whiteboard | `https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/whiteboard/streamable` |
| Team Chat | `https://mcp.zoom.us/mcp/team_chat/streamable` |

Zoom also exposes SSE variants at the same paths with `/sse` instead of `/streamable`.
