# X Ads

Cursor plugin that connects agents to the [X Ads API](https://docs.x.com/x-ads-api/introduction) through X's official hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server at `https://ads-api.x.com/mcp`.

This plugin signs you in with OAuth as your own X account and works with the ads accounts you can access. Agents can manage campaigns, create ads, set up pixels and conversion tracking, and pull performance stats.

This is a separate plugin from the [X](../x/) plugin: the ads MCP server lives on a different subdomain (`ads-api.x.com` vs `api.x.com`) and requires different OAuth scopes, so it needs its own authorization. Installing both means signing in twice — once per plugin.

<!-- claude-code:start -->
## Install in Claude Code

Add the MCP server this plugin uses:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user \
  --client-id NGdZYmo4VVp2T1BnRG55NlExOGQ6MTpjaQ \
  --callback-port 8787 \
  x-ads \
  https://ads-api.x.com/mcp
```

- The client ID is the one upstream ships for Cursor. The command uses port 8787 to match Cursor's desktop redirect, but nobody has tested this sign-in from Claude Code.
- `claude mcp add` has no flag for OAuth scopes, so the server's defaults apply: `ads.read`, `ads.write`, `media.write`, `offline.access`.
- Run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to finish any sign-in and check that the server connected.
- `--scope user` makes the server available in every project. Use `--scope project` to share it through the repo's `.mcp.json`.

## Install

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Plugins**.
2. Search for **X Ads**.
3. Click **Install**, then complete the OAuth sign-in when prompted.

Or run `/add-plugin x-ads` in chat.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts | Read your ads accounts, funding instruments, and settings |
| Campaigns | Create, update, pause, and read campaigns and line items |

| Audiences | Read and manage targeting and audiences |
| Pixels & conversions | Set up the X pixel and conversion tracking |
| Analytics | Pull campaign, line item, and ad performance stats |

## Setup

No token to paste — the plugin ships with X's OAuth client ID (the same one the X connector uses) and requests the scopes below. On first use, Cursor opens a browser window where you sign in to X and approve access. The `offline.access` scope lets Cursor refresh the session automatically, so you only sign in once.

Requests run in your user context against the ads accounts your X account can access. You can revoke access at any time from your X account's connected apps settings.

## Scopes requested

`ads.read`, `ads.write`, `media.write`, `offline.access`
