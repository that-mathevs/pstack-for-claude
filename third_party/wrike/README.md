# Wrike

Cursor plugin that connects agents to [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com) through Wrike's official remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server.

Search a Wrike workspace, navigate folder and project hierarchies, and create or update tasks, projects, and comments.

<!-- claude-code:start -->
## Install in Claude Code

Add the MCP server this plugin uses:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${WRIKE_ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  wrike \
  https://mcp.wrike.com/v2
```

- Export `WRIKE_ACCESS_TOKEN` before you run the command. Your shell fills in the value, and Claude Code saves it in `~/.claude.json`.
- Run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to finish any sign-in and check that the server connected.
- `--scope user` makes the server available in every project. Use `--scope project` to share it through the repo's `.mcp.json`.

<!-- claude-code:end -->

## Install

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Plugins**.
2. Search for **Wrike**.
3. Click **Install**, then set your Wrike permanent access token (below).

Or run `/add-plugin wrike` in chat.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wrike": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.wrike.com/v2",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${WRIKE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Auth is a Wrike **permanent access token** sent as a bearer token. Create one under **Apps & Integrations → API**, then set it in **Dashboard → Plugins → Configure**.

Wrike's MCP server does not offer Dynamic Client Registration, so a token is the supported path for clients like Cursor rather than a browser OAuth flow.

## Before you connect

Wrike MCP is available on all plans (Free, Team, Business, Pinnacle, and Apex). Creating the token requires Wrike API permissions, which Account Owners have by default.

## What agents can do

| Category | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Unified search across the workspace |
| Navigation | Browse folders, projects, and spaces |
| Tasks | Create and update tasks, including bulk actions |
| Comments & inbox | Post comments and read the Wrike inbox |
| Metadata | Time logs, contacts, and custom fields |

The hosted runtime is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

## Notes

- Tool calls run with the permissions of the user who owns the token.
- `https://mcp.wrike.com/v2` is served over streamable HTTP only — there is no SSE fallback.
- The older `https://mcp.wrike.com/app/mcp/stream` and `https://mcp.wrike.com/app/mcp/sse` URLs are MCP v1 and serve an older tool set. Some Wrike pages still reference them.
- Wrike also supports connector-style OAuth using a client ID and secret from an OAuth app an admin creates. That path is aimed at hosted connectors rather than local clients.
