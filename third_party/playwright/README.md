# Playwright

Cursor plugin that connects agents to a real browser through Microsoft's [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) server.

Navigate pages, click and fill elements, take accessibility snapshots and screenshots, and run end-to-end checks from chat.

<!-- claude-code:start -->
## Install in Claude Code

The official Claude Code plugin `playwright` connects to this service. Install it instead of adding the server by hand:

```bash
claude plugin install playwright@claude-plugins-official
```

To add the same MCP server this plugin uses without the official plugin:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user \
  playwright \
  -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
```

- Run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to finish any sign-in and check that the server connected.
- `--scope user` makes the server available in every project. Use `--scope project` to share it through the repo's `.mcp.json`.

## Install

1. Open **Cursor Settings → Plugins**.
2. Search for **Playwright**.
3. Click **Install**.

Or run `/add-plugin playwright` in chat.

## Requirements

This is a **local stdio** MCP server. Cursor launches it with `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`, so the machine running Cursor needs **Node.js** installed and on `PATH`. The `-y` flag skips `npx`'s install confirmation so the first launch cannot hang waiting for interactive input over stdio.

The first run downloads Playwright's browser binaries. That can take a minute and needs network access; later runs reuse the cached browsers.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

No credentials are required. The server runs locally and drives a browser on the same machine.
